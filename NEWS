0.1
--------------------------------------------
* First prototype version of DB packager


Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
--------------------------------------------
* New version of STANDARD (0.2)
* Added metadata control - now packager is able to control information 
  of what (DB/application/package) is installed, and based 
  on which version of standard
* Installer now handles more commands. I old version it was 
      {new,existent} x {new,existent} 
      for (DB x Application)
  , but now it's
      {drop,new,overwrite,existent,list} x
      {drop,new,overwrite,existent,list} x
      {drop,new,overwrite,existent}
      for (DB x Application x Package)
* Major package structure advancement. DDL scrips separated into DROP and INIT
  parts.


Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
--------------------------------------------
* Now there are two states of package: packed and unpacked.
  Older version had only unpacked. In packed state is easier to concetrate on
  package "business" content. In unpacked state it's easier to develope
  newer versions of STANDARD.
* PKG-INFO file doesn't contain a list of files anymore. 
  Due to arising complexities, when transfering between "packed" and "unpacked"
  states.
